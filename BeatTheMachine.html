				<div class = "portfolioTextBody">One of the my primary responsibilities for Beat the Machine was to create some of the more common enemies that the player would face on a very regular basis. I created 7 different enemies types, each having several tiers that influence base stats like health, damage and movement speed. These enemies have a variety of different attack, movements, and unique mechanics that work together to create the core gameplay loop of Beat The Machine.</div>

				<div class = "portfolioTextBody">While the basic enemies make up a larger portion of the gameplay loop, bosses create memorable moments for the player, and their behavior needs to reflect that. As the AI programmer, I worked together with the design lead and project manager to create interactive behaviors for these powerful opponents, then proceeded to implement 5 full length boss encounters, each of which has multiple phases and attack routines.</div>

				<div class = "portfolioTextBody">Hazards are obstacles located throughout the game that the player needs to interact with in some way in order to get through the level. In Beat the Machine, these hazards range from fans that push the player to doors that don't open until you kill a certain amount of enemies. I worked on 8 different hazards for the game, each offering unique gameplay.</div>
