				<div class = "portfolioTextBody"> The most important mechanic of the game are the cards themselves. I worked on developing the mechanics to store and display the player's deck and hand, as well as tracking cards that were played and discarded. I also created each card's effect, and a system to evaluate the outcome of advanced card combinations.</div>

				<div class = "portfolioTextBody"> I built a robust save system for Ballroom Banter to ensure that game data never gets lost. All important data is put into a custom class and then serialized and saved on the device, which occurs on application closing as well as certain checkpoints in the game. I also implemented devtodev analytics into the game, allowing analysis of player gameplay, session length, etc.</div>
