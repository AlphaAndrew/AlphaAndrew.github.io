					<div class = "projectTextBody">Beat The Machine is a 3D top-down retro arcade twin-stick shooter where the player takes on the role of an anti-virus inside of a computer fighting off hordes of invaders. Created over the course of one year, I worked as the programming lead and AI programmer. As the programming lead for this project, I co-ordinated a team of five programmers, as well as provided creative and technical input on the direction of the game. As the AI programmer for the project, I created the enemy AI for the project as well as a multitude of other gameplay mechanics.</div>

					<div class = "projectTextBody">Legends and Warfare is a 3/4 top-down Massive Online Battle Arena(MOBA). LAW was a project created by a team of 15 students over the course of four semesters. I was the Programming lead for the final semester of the project, and the AI programmer for the entirety of development. For this project I primarily worked on the minion behaviors, making them move and fight in the desired manner. I also developed the AI for the towers, focusing on targeting different types of players and enemies in a certain priority.</div>

					<div class = "projectTextTitle">Tools Programmer/Database Engineer</div>
					<div class = "projectTextBody">Working with a small team, I created in-engine tools in order to improve workflow and efficiency for a larger studio team. These tools were made in Unity and included the framework for designers to build multiple levels with a variety of scripted behaviors with little to no programmer input. I also integrated Microsoft Playfab into the project in order to track user analytics. This included building a fully functioning login and sign up system, as well as creating tools for designers to store gameplay data linked to accounts. </div>
