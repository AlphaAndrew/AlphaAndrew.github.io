				<div class = "portfolioTextBody">This project revolves around a large amount of minigames being available in different settings for the players to choose from. In order to create a vast amount of unique and interesting games, the primary team required a lot of programming work. In order to alleviate that need, a smaller team was formed to set up a workflow so that the main team could focus elsewhere while the minigames were being programmed. As such, I helped to create 6 different minigame frameworks that were then handed over to the primary team for the design and art teams to easily implement.</div>

				<div class = "portfolioTextBody"> The project also required an analytics and data storage system in order to save certain player data and to help the client analyze the player base. In order to accomplish this we used Microsoft Playfab as our backend storage. Working with the Playfab API within Unity, I created a login and signup system that would allow players to create an account that would be saved with their data. From there, the player's activity throughout the game could be tracked. Due to this we could ultimately compile aggregated data about the behavior of the players within the game. </div>
